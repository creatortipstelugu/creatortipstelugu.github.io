    <!-- Chosen Palette: Neutral Harmony with Red Accent -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured thematically to follow a logical creator workflow: Creation, Optimization, Connection, Monetization, and Safety. This task-oriented design is more intuitive for creators than a simple feature list. It begins with a high-level overview and a donut chart visualizing key investment areas, then allows users to dive into specific toolsets. Navigation is handled by a sticky header, and content is presented in interactive cards that reveal more detail on click. This structure was chosen to transform the unstructured source notes into a guided, easily digestible exploration of the new YouTube ecosystem. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Key Areas of Investment (Creation, Connection, Business, AI). Goal: Inform on strategic priorities. Viz/Presentation: Donut Chart. Interaction: Hover tooltips. Justification: Quickly shows the proportional focus of YouTube's strategy. Library: Chart.js (Canvas).
        - Report Info: All new features (e.g., V3, Ask Studio, Collabs). Goal: Organize and detail new tools. Viz/Presentation: Interactive cards with icons, titles, and descriptions. Interaction: Click to expand for more detail. Justification: Breaks down dense information into manageable, self-contained units that users can explore at their own pace. Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
        - Report Info: $100 Billion Payout. Goal: Inform/Impact. Viz/Presentation: Key Stat/Metric card. Interaction: Static display. Justification: A powerful headline number to grab attention. Method: HTML/CSS.
        - All choices support the thematic structure and avoid SVG/Mermaid in favor of Canvas and structured HTML/CSS for a fast, responsive, and maintainable single-page application. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
